# Basic Node route-handling mock

> This is a Node server that handles multiple routes, and serves basic HTML content

----

###### I also used this test to demonstrate my initial knowledge of how _Buffers_ work in Nodejs

----

###### Node steadily takes in streams of data, therefore, Buffers are specific _stops_ where you can interact with that data stream 

*On the /create-users endpoint, I concatenate each Buffer and then convert it to a string. It recieves data that is entered into the HTML form by a user.*
